This package attempts to implement group theory. Yes, the eventual aim is to implement all of it. It might take a while to get there, but we are making progress.

Currently it is restricted to finite symmetric groups, dihedral groups and cyclic groups, though subgroups of these can be generated. The infinite groups that are covered currently include the integers under addition.  

However, it may well expand...
