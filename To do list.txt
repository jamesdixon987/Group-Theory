FUNCTIONALITY NEEDING FIXING:

* Finish writing __eq__ for groups
* Finish cayley table for finite groups


NEXT STEPS:

* Would like to find another infinite group to implement (one that is not isomorphic to Z) - Z is a bit lonely. Not sure which one yet.

IN THE FUTURE:
* Homomorphisms
* find_isomorphism() for finite groups
* is_simple() function for finite groups
* is_nilpotent() function for finite groups
