FUNCTIONALITY NEEDING FIXING:

* Sort out all properties and create some help documentation listing what properties need to be created for all types of new groups implemented in the program.
* Sort out why FinGroup has an associated_group property. (Fails unittests if removed).



NEXT STEPS:

* Normal Subgroups
* Product of two groups to make new group
* Would like to find another infinite group to implement (one that is not isomorphic to Z) - Z is a bit lonely. Not sure which one yet.

PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE:
* Homomorphisms
* is_simple() function for finite groups
