FUNCTIONALITY NEEDING FIXING:

* Generating set for symmetric groups contains different instances of objects from the element lost. Perhaps a 'return_element' function that will find an element object corresponding to a specific function?



NEXT STEPS:

* Normal Subgroups
* Product of two groups to make new group
* Would like to find another infinite group to implement (one that is not isomorphic to Z) - Z is a bit lonely. Not sure which one yet.

PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE:
* Homomorphisms
* is_simple() function for finite groups
