FUNCTIONALITY NEEDING FIXING:

* Sort out all properties and create some help documentation listing what properties need to be created for all types of new groups implemented in the program.
* Sort out why FinGroup has an associated_group property. (Fails unittests if removed).
* Finish writing __eq__ for groups
* Finish cayley table for finite groups


NEXT STEPS:

* Normal Subgroups
* Would like to find another infinite group to implement (one that is not isomorphic to Z) - Z is a bit lonely. Not sure which one yet.

IN THE FUTURE:
* Homomorphisms
* find_isomorphism() for finite groups
* is_simple() function for finite groups
* is_nilpotent() function for finite groups
